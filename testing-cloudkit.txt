Herein is described a method for full stack testing "CloudKit":http://getcloudkit.com/ apps. The same techniques could easily be applied to other rack web application or framework, which is pretty much all the ruby ones these days ("rails":http://rubyonrails.org/, "sinatra":http://www.sinatrarb.com/, "pancake":http://github.com/hassox/pancake, etc...)

There are two external services that make up our stack:
* CloudKit application
* OpenID server

Both of these are rack applications, so we can start them up using the same method in our spec helper.

--- Ruby
require 'spec'
require 'pathname'
require Pathname(__FILE__).dirname + 'support/application_server'
require Pathname(__FILE__).dirname + 'support/tcp_socket'

TEST_PORTS = {
  :app    => 9293,
  :openid => 9294
}

$servers = nil
Spec::Runner.configure do |config|
  config.before(:all) do
    $servers ||= Support::ApplicationServer.multi_boot(
      {
        :config    => File.expand_path(Dir.pwd + '/config.ru'),
        :port      => TEST_PORTS[:app],
        :daemonize => true
      },
      {
        :config    => File.expand_path(Dir.pwd + '/spec/support/rack_my_id.rb'),
        :port      => TEST_PORTS[:openid],
        :daemonize => true
      }
    )
  end
end

You need some support files - the first two are based heavily on code from webrat, the latter is a dead simple OpenID server that I wrote specifically for testing:
* "application_server.rb":http://gist.github.com/237652
* "tcp_socker.rb":http://gist.github.com/237652
* "rack_my_id.rb":http://github.com/xaviershay/rack-my-id

A global variable is required here, since @before(:all)@ in rspec runs once per describe block, rather than once per test run. An @at_exit@ hook is used to shutdown the services after the test run.

You need a way of resetting your data between test runs. The default @CloudKit::MemoryTable@ does not provide a mechanism for this - any deleted resource will exist in the version history of that resource (and will respond with a 410 rather than 404). By subclassing @MemoryTable@, we can provide a @purge@ method that does what we need:

--- Ruby
# A custom storage adapter that allows a total purge of a collection
# This is handy in test mode to clear out data between specs
class PurgeableTable < CloudKit::MemoryTable
  # Remove all resources in a collection.
  # Unlike a normal delete, which versions the resource (and sets up a 410 response),
  # this method removes all trace of the resource (it will 404).
  #
  # Example:
  #   CloudKit.setup_storage_adapter(adapter = PurgeableTable.new)
  #   adapter.purge('/items')
  def purge(collection)
    query {|q|
      q.add_condition('collection_reference', :eql, collection)
    }.each do |item|
      @hash.delete(@keys.delete(item[:pk]))
    end
  end
end
---

Since we'll be testing the CloudKit app from a separate process, we also need a way of triggering a purge. An easy way is some custom rack middleware that provides a URL we can hit to reset the app. Clearly, we only want to enable this in test mode.

--- Ruby
class ResetApp
  def initialize(app, options = {})
    @app = app
    @options = options
  end

  def call(env)
    request = Rack::Request.new(env)
    if request.path == '/test_reset' && request.request_method == 'POST'
      @options[:adapter].purge('/items')
      return Rack::Response.new([], 200).finish
    else
      @app.call(env)
    end
  end
end
---

--- Ruby
# config.ru
CloudKit.setup_storage_adapter(adapter = PurgeableTable.new)

if ENV["RACK_ENV"] == 'test'
  use ResetApp, :adapter => adapter
end
---

Now all the infrastructure is set up, we can test the CloudKit app using familiar ruby HTTP libraries:

--- Ruby
require 'httparty'
require 'mechanize'
require 'json'
require 'oauth'

describe 'OAuth + OpendID' do
  include HTTParty
  base_uri "localhost:#{TEST_PORTS[:app]}"

  before(:each) do
    HTTParty.post("/test_reset").code.should == 200
  end

  specify 'Registering for an oauth token' do
    @consumer = OAuth::Consumer.new('cloudkitconsumer','',
      :site               => "http://localhost:#{TEST_PORTS[:app]}",
      :authorize_path     => "/oauth/authorization",
      :access_token_path  => "/oauth/access_tokens",
      :request_token_path => "/oauth/request_tokens"
    )
    @request_token = @consumer.get_request_token

    agent = WWW::Mechanize.new
    page = agent.get(@request_token.authorize_url)
    login_form = page.forms.first
    login_form.field_with(:name => "openid_url").value = "localhost:#{TEST_PORTS[:openid]}"
    page = agent.submit(login_form)

    oauth_form = page.forms.first
    page = agent.submit(oauth_form, oauth_form.button_with(:value => "Approve"))

    # Get access token
    @access_token = @request_token.get_access_token

    # Update an item
    result = @access_token.put("/items/12345", {:name => "Hello"}.to_json)
    result.code.should == "201"
  end
end

There's a lot of code and not much supporting text here. I'm hoping it all just clicks together pretty easy. Hit me up with any questions.
